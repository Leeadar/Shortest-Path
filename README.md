This project is a solution to the problem of finding a path between two vertices.

There are three solutions for the problem:

1. Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm using Minimum Priority Queue
2. Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm using an unsorted array Priority Queue
3. Bellman–Ford algorithm


The graph is implemented in each algorithm in 2 ways:
1. Adjacency Matrix
2. Adjacency List


The input is a file that contains the number of vertices in the graph, the origin vertex, and the destination vertex.
Then the rest of the file contains a list of edges, origin and destination vertex, and the weight of the edge.

The program prints the weight of the shortest path between the origin vertex to the destintaion vertex
